WIP - A lightweight, FP-based, Processing-inspired 2d creative coding library for developers. This library leverages as many built-in concepts and APIs in HTML5 (e.g. canvas, css colors, etc.).

Currently, this project is a proof-of-concept for some personal coding projects. But I inteded to grow it into a library for others to use as it matures.
